<h2>LILLE</h2>


<h3>ORIGIN AND CHIEF HISTORICAL EVENTS</h3>

<p>The marvellous tales of <em>"Liliane"</em> and the forest rangers <em>Phin&#339;rt</em>
and <em>Lyderic</em>, which take Lille back to the days of Julius C&aelig;sar, are mythical.
The first mention of Lille in history dates back to the 11th century, when
the town was divided into the <em>"castrum"</em> or entrenched camp of the Counts
of Flanders (where Baudoin V. erected the Basilica and Forum in about 1050),
and the <em>"forum"</em> (to-day the Grand' Place), where the church of St. Martin
already existed.</p>

<p>The <em>"forum"</em> grew rapidly in the 12th century; the suburb of Fives,
with its two churches of St. Saviour and St. Maurice, being enclosed within
the new wall. There were no further changes of importance until the
17th century, when the Vauban fortifications to the north further enlarged
the town. It was only in 1858 that Moulins, Vazemmes and Esquermes
were included in the southern portion of the town, leaving the important
suburbs of Fives and St. Maurice outside the ramparts.</p>

<p>Its situation on the frontier embroiled Lille in all the great wars. In
1213, <em>Philippe-August</em> took it twice from Count Ferrand, burning it completely
the second time, to punish the inhabitants for having received their
former chief. <em>Philippe le Bel</em> took it in 1297, and built the Ch&acirc;teau de
Courtrai to commemorate the event. The <em>Flemish</em> conquered it in 1302,
but were defeated in 1304 at Mons-en-Puelle by Philippe, who forced them
to abandon the town after a month's siege. Then, for half-a-century, Lille
belonged to the Kings of France, but the marriage of the Duke of Burgundy,
<em>Philippe le Hardi</em>, with the Heiress of Flanders, in 1369, restored it to the
counts. When <em>Maximilian of Austria</em> espoused Marie of Burgundy, daughter
and Heir of Charles the Bold, last Duke of Burgundy, Lille became part of
his dominions.</p>

<p>At the head of his armies, <em>Louis XIV.</em> besieged and took it in 1667
after "nine days of trench fighting," and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
confirmed the capture.</p>

<p>As an advanced citadel, it defended the northern frontier, but in 1708,
the <em>Spanish</em> were before its gates, and Marshal de Boufflers, after exhausting
his supplies and ammunition, was obliged to surrender to Prince Eug&egrave;ne
and the Duke of Marlborough. After a five years' occupation, the Treaty
of Utrecht gave it back to France in 1713.</p>

<p>In 1792, it was besieged by 30,000 Austrians under <em>Albert of Saxe-Coburg</em>,
who bombarded it day and night for nine days. The famous <em>Lille gunners</em>
beat off the enemy, who raised the siege, and the Convention having decreed
that "the town deserved well of the country," a commemorative column
was erected in the Grand' Place <em>(p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>In the Franco-German War of 1870-1871, Lille remained outside the
battle area, and the only local souvenir connected with that struggle was
a visit from <em>M. Antonin Dubost</em> (now Pr&eacute;sident of the French Senate) in
October, 1870. Leaving Paris, which was besieged, in a balloon named
"The Universal Republic," he landed between Rocroi and M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, going
thence on foot to Belgium, and from there to Lille. He was received by
the Commissary of the Government for National Defence (Mr. Testelin)
<em>(p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>)</em> and General Bourbaki, who had escaped from Metz, and harangued
the people from the steps of the Grand' Garde <em>(Place de la Bourse, p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>In 1914, the victorious Germans were at its gates, and the Capital of
Flanders was destined to suffer a four years' occupation.</p>

<h3>LILLE AND THE GREAT WAR</h3>


<h4>Importance and Military Situation of Lille in 1914</h4>

<p>Lying between the rivers Lys, Escaut and Scarpe, in the plain before
the hills of Artois, Lille forms an isolated advance-post between <em>Maubeuge</em>
(which guards the Pass of the Oise), and <em>Dunkirk</em> (which commands the
region of the Dunes). <em>Vauban</em> had fortified the place, but the treaties
of 1815 and 1871 deprived France of her essential points of support, and
rendered these defences valueless. In 1873, <em>General S&eacute;r&eacute; de Rivi&egrave;res</em>,
Director of the Engineering Section at the Ministry of War, commenced
a comprehensive scheme which aimed at the reorganization of the entire
northern frontier, whereof Lille was one of the pivots.</p>

<p>Situated in the centre of France's richest coalfields and allied industries,
Lille has justly been called "the Key to France's Treasure-House" (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a><br /><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a><br /><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><em>"Le secret de la fronti&egrave;re,"</em> by M. Fernand Engerand, 1918). To enable
it to withstand a surprise attack and hold out against a long siege, the city's
intermediate defences were increased to such a degree that Lille became
the point of support of the French frontier between the rivers Sambre and
Lys. By thus protecting the Arsenal of Douai, it became possible to assemble
a reserve army within the entrenched camp of Lille, 31 miles in length. The
total cost of these works was 126,000,000 frs.</p>

<p>But, as in Vauban's days, a reactionary movement set in against defensive
works, and it was demonstrated by their opponents that besieged towns
must fall, and that in future the destinies of nations would be decided
in the open battlefield. In 1880, the works of S&eacute;r&eacute; de Rivi&egrave;res were
abandoned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_b_004a.jpg" width="600" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>NAPOL&Eacute;ON BRIDGE DESTROYED BY THE RETREATING GERMANS <em>(see p. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>)</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime, the great cities of the north, with Lille at their head,
had become industrial centres of primary importance, thanks to their wealth
of raw materials (coal, iron and steel). To protect them from the horrors
of war, it was considered only necessary to make open towns of them.
The fortifications of Lille were among the first to be condemned, as being
of no real value, and a Bill to this effect was passed by Parliament.</p>

<p>Collaborators of S&eacute;r&eacute; de Rivi&egrave;res gave the alarm in March, 1899, pointing
out that the neutrality of Belgium was insufficient protection, that its
violation was inevitable, that the Pass of the Oise was an open road for
invasion, that with Lille outflanked, the Forest of Saint-Gobain (which Laon
and La F&egrave;re, whose dismantling the Bill provided for, would no longer be
able to protect) would fall, and that the enemy would be at the gates of
Paris within a few days.</p>

<p>Finally, the fortifications of Lille were not dismantled, but were allowed
to fall into disuse.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the eastern frontier was considerably strengthened. It
was in vain that the <em>Belgian General Brialmont</em>, who had just completed the
forts of Antwerp and Liege, pointed out that the abandonment of the northern
frontier would inevitably cause a violation of Belgium's neutrality. Like
her peaceful neighbour, France relied on the sacredness of treaties, and made
it a point of honour to leave that part of her frontier practically unprotected.</p>

<p>At that time, Germany was neglecting the East, and making all her
railways converge towards the Pass of the Oise. In other words, a frontal
attack against the East being considered impracticable, Germany decided
to turn it from the north. The fortifications of Lille were again condemned
in November, 1911, and it is a curious coincidence that this was the year
of the <em>Agadir Incident</em> and of the first tangible German threats of war.</p>

<p>In July, 1914, 3,000 artillery-men and nearly a third of the guns had
been removed from the fortifications. On August 1st, the Governor, General
Lebas, received orders to consider Lille an open town, but on August 21st
his successor, General Herment, increased the garrison troops from 15,000
to 25,000, and later, to 28,000 men, taking units from each of the regiments
in the 1st region. At this time, the armament consisted of 446 guns and
79,788 shells, to which were added 9,000,000 cartridges, 3,000 75 mm. shells
and 12 47 mm. guns sent from Paris.</p>


<h4>How Lille fell in 1914</h4>

<p class="center"><em>(See Maps on pages <a href="#Page_3">3</a> and <a href="#Page_6">6</a>)</em>
</p>

<p>At the beginning of the battle of Charleroi, <em>General d'Amade</em> was in
the vicinity of Lille, with territorial divisions extending from <em>Dunkirk</em> to
<em>Maubeuge</em>. The 82nd Division alone held the entire space between the
Escaut and the Scarpe, with advance posts at Tournai and Lille. It was
manifest that these troops were insufficient to offer serious resistance.
However, the first care was to defend the town. For two days,
trenches and shelters were made, and the troops sent to their respective
positions.</p>

<p>On August 23rd, the British, defeated on the previous day at Mons, retreated,
leaving Tournai unprotected. The Germans drove out the 82nd territorial
Division and entered the town. Elsewhere, they advanced as far as
Roubaix-Tourcoing, blowing up the station of Mouscron. The French
territorials counter-attacked vigorously, and units of the 83rd and 84th
regiments reoccupied Tournai during the night.</p>

<p>In the early morning of the 24th, <em>General de Villaret</em>, commanding the
170th Brigade, organized the defence of the bridges over the Escaut, where
sharp fighting took place. However, his troops were obliged to fall back
about noon, before the numerically superior enemy forces.</p>

<p>While these events were taking place close to Lille, the Mayor requested
that the town should not be needlessly exposed to the horrors of a siege.
A meeting of the principal civil authorities (town councillors and members
of both Houses of Parliament) was held, at which it was decided to petition
the Government to declare the town open, and withdraw the military. At
5 p.m. on the 24th, a telegram arrived from the War Minister, with orders
to consider Lille undefended, and to evacuate the troops between La Bass&eacute;e
and Aire-sur-la-Lys.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the right wing of the German army was reported to be
advancing, protected by about three divisions of cavalry with supporting
artillery. Patrols reached the outskirts of the town soon afterwards.</p>

<p>General Herment executed the orders he had received. Moreover,
he knew that the neighbouring town of Maubeuge was holding out with
45,000 men, and that the Belgian army was intact at Antwerp.</p>

<p>On September 2nd, enemy detachments entered Lille, disappearing three
days later. The town was only occupied by patrols, who had orders to
secure the German right (Von Kluck's army), which was executing its famous
flanking movement. Then came the <em>Victory of the Marne</em>. After the
German retreat and the indecisive <em>Battle of the Aisne</em>, the enemy began their
northward movement known as the "Race for the Sea," the aim of which,
on either side, was to turn the adversary's wing.</p>

<p>On October 3rd, Joffre joined the 10th army under <em>General de Maud'huy</em>
to reinforce his left and prevent its envelopment. The 21st Army Corps
arrived from Champagne, and the 13th Division detrained to the west
of the town.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th, battalions of Chasseurs, belonging to the
13th Division, received orders to take up positions to the north and east
of the town. After spending the night at Armenti&egrave;res, they passed through
Lille, where they had an enthusiastic reception.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_b_006a.jpg" width="700" height="697" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The 17th Battalion, which was to occupy the suburb of Fives, was met
with a sharp fusillade as it left the ramparts. Organizing promptly, it
drove the enemy from the railway station and fortifications, capturing a
number of machine-guns and prisoners. To the north of the town, the
French troops came into contact with German patrols near Wambrechies
and Marquette, while the 7th cavalry Division had skirmishes in the neighbourhood
of Fouquet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the garrison, consisting of territorials and Algerian mounted
troops, took up positions to the south of Faches and Wattignies, in liaison,
at Ronchin, with other units of the 13th Division. The enemy attacked at
this point, and reached the railway.</p>

<p>On the 5th, after a sharp counter-attack, the French took Fives, Hellemmes,
Flers, the Fort of Mons-en-Bar&#339;ul and Ronchin. To the west of the town
cavalry engagements took place along the Ypres Canal. On the 6th, the
13th Division left the outskirts of the town, following the 21st Corps in the
direction of Artois. Only two battalions of Chasseurs were left in Lille.</p>

<p>On the 7th, the two battalions of Chasseurs rejoined the 13th Division,
the defence of Lille being left to the territorials and Algerian troops. On
the 9th and 10th, the 2nd cavalry Corps engaged the enemy near Estaires-Merville
(between Aire-sur-la-Lys and Armenti&egrave;res), but was unable to open
the road to Lille, which was then left to its fate.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. on the 9th, the first enemy aeroplane appeared, and dropped
two bombs on the General Post Office. In the afternoon, all men from 18 to
48 years of age were ordered to the B&eacute;thune Gate, with instructions to leave
Lille immediately.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">

<div class="caption"><p>AFTER THE
BOMBARDMENT:
A FALLING
HOUSE IN THE
RUE DE PARIS</p></div>
</div>

<p>A crowd of people from Lille, Tourcoing, Roubaix and the neighbouring
villages, left on foot for Dunkirk and Gravelines. Several died on the way
of exhaustion, others being taken prisoners by the Uhlans. The last train
left at day-break on the 10th. At 9 a.m., the first enemy shell burst, being
followed by many others which fell in the neighbourhood of the station,
and on the Prefecture and Palais des Beaux-Arts. The afternoon was quiet,
but at 9 a.m. the bombardment began again, lasting until 1 in the morning,
then from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. On the 12th, when
the garrison capitulated, 80 civilians had been killed and numerous buildings
destroyed by the bombardment. That part of the town near the railway
station was almost entirely destroyed <em>(see plan, p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>The Rue Faidherbe, Caf&eacute; Jean, Grand H&ocirc;tel, Grande Pharmacie de France,
part of the Rue des Ponts-de-Comines, and the whole of the Rue du Vieux-March&eacute;-aux-Poulets,
were in ruins. The H&ocirc;tel Continental in the Parvis-St.-Maurice
Square, was a mere heap of rubbish. The Rue de B&eacute;thune, Rue de
l'H&ocirc;pital-Militaire and Rue du Molinel were partially destroyed. In the
Boulevard de la Libert&eacute;, the premises of the "Belle Jardini&egrave;re" Stores were
wiped out <em>(p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>At 9 a.m., on October 13th, while hundreds of fires were still burning,
five companies of Bavarian troops entered the town, followed throughout
the day by Uhlans, Dragoons, Artillery, "Death Hussars" and Infantry.
The occupation had begun.</p>

and forced the enemy to retreat along a wide front.</em></p></div>
</div>


<h4>The Deliverance</h4>

<p>For more than three years the inhabitants of Lille had heard the
guns thundering almost at their gates, as for a long while the front was
bounded by Armenti&egrave;res and Lens. In <em>December, 1914</em>, the Battle of
Artois partially cleared Arras. The offensive of <em>May-June, 1915</em>, was marked
by the capture of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Ablain-St.-Nazaire, Carency,
Souchez, stopping at Vimy Ridge and hemming in Lens on the south. The
victory of <em>September-October, 1915</em>, cleared Lens further to the north, by
the capture of Loos. In <em>March, 1918</em>, a powerful German offensive from
Armenti&egrave;res, forced the Allies back for several months, until the successive
and correlated offensives of the Allies, under Foch, beginning on July 18th,
finally liberated the French soil, town by town, and village by village. In
August and September there was an advance along the whole front from the
Argonne to the Artois, while in October, the Artois-Picardy front also burst
into flames.</p>

<p>While the <em>French</em>, in the centre of their line of attack, crossed the Oise
at Mont-d'Origny, to the south-west of Guise, the <em>British</em>, north of Douai and
east of Lens, encircled Lille more closely on the south, and approached
S&eacute;clin, Aubourdin and Quesnoy-sur-Deule.</p>

<p>At the other end of the front, on the left, <em>Belgian</em>, <em>British</em> and <em>French</em>
forces under the <em>King of Belgium, Albert I.</em>, took the offensive, and on
the 14th, 15th and 16th. of October, in spite of the rain and mud, took
Roulers and Thourout. Meanwhile, the 2nd British Army captured Menin,
crossed the Lys 9 miles from Lille, taking from the rear the northern defences
of the latter. In possession of Menin and Bouchain, the British continued
to encircle Lille and Douai, and approached the two ends of the important
Menin-Tourcoing-Roubaix-Cysoing-Orchies-Somain-Cambrai railway.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the Germans, who were preparing to evacuate Lille, destroyed
the railway behind them, and on the 15th, burnt the goods station of St.
Sauveur, after hurriedly plundering it.</p>

<p>At 4 a.m. on the 17th, the inhabitants were ordered to form up and march
towards the British lines.</p>

<p>At 5 a.m. on the 17th the last of the Germans left Lille, after blowing up
all the bridges and a number of locks on the canal.</p>

<p>At noon, on the 1,536th day of the war, the 5th British Army entered
Lille, after a four years' occupation.</p>

<p>Although they had organized powerful defences to a depth of 12 miles
around the town (barbed-wire entanglements, concrete trenches, etc.), the
Germans made only a faint show of resistance. To console the people at
home, the newspapers <em>(Strassburger Post)</em> announced that <em>"retreat was the
only way to preserve the elasticity of the front and prevent a break-through at all
costs."</em> (See opposite, map showing, step by step, the advance of the Allies,
from August 1st to October 18th, 1918.)</p>

<p>The joy of the liberated population may best be expressed by the words
with which the <em>Mayor of Lille</em> received <em>Pr&eacute;sident Poincar&eacute;</em> on October 21st:
<em>"For four years we have been like miners buried alive, listening for the sound
of the rescuers' picks; then all at once the dark gallery opens and we perceive
the light."</em></p>

<p>In Paris, the news was received with singing and cheers. In the Place
de la Concorde, the Statue of Lille was decorated with the French and British
colours and flowers. The Fourth National Loan, named the "Liberation
Loan," opened under the most favourable conditions.</p>

<h3>THE GERMAN OCCUPATION</h3>

<p>The German occupation began on October 13th, 1914. From the 13th
to the 28th of that month it was <em>Major-General Wahlschaffe</em> who directed
the operations, levied the War Contributions and chose the hostages. His
successor, <em>Artillery General Von Heinrich</em>, was appointed Governor on
October 25th, and held the post until December 27th, 1916, when he was
made Governor of Bucharest. <em>General Von Graevenitz</em> was Chief of the
Kommandantur, which occupied the premises of the Credit du Nord bank
in the Rue Jean Roisin.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Hostages and War Contributions</h4>

<p><strong>Sixty hostages</strong> were chosen from among the most notable persons in
the town, and included the Bishop <em>(Mgr. Charost)</em>, the Prefect of the North
<em>(M. Tr&eacute;pont)</em>, <em>MM. Delory</em> and <em>Ghesqui&egrave;re</em>, Members of Parliament, the
Mayor <em>(M. Delesalle)</em> and deputy mayors. In groups of ten they were made
to spend the night in turns at the Citadelle <em>(photo, p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>From December 31st, they were required merely to sign a presence-sheet,
but were later again forced to spend the whole of their time (day and night)
in the Citadelle, this time in groups of five. Finally, they had to sign a
presence-sheet each morning and evening until October 5th, 1915, when
this formality was dispensed with, <em>i.e.</em> after the Census operations had been
completed.</p>

<p>In November, 1914, began exorbitant exactions in the guise of <strong>War
Contributions</strong>. On the 4th, Von Graevenitz demanded a million francs to
be paid on the 10th; then two millions on the 17th, and three millions on the
24th, in addition to the expense of feeding the troops, which alone amounted
to 10,000 frs. daily. After much negotiating the Governor finally agreed
first to give more time, then to reduce the amounts of the contributions.</p>

<p>To ensure an effective control, a very strict <em>census</em> of the population was
taken on August 27th, 1915. Particulars of the persons in each house were
constantly posted up, and after September 1st <strong>identity-cards</strong> with photographs
were obligatory. To be found in the street or even standing on one's
doorstep without this card, was punishable by fine (3 to 30 marks) or imprisonment
(one to three days).</p>

</div>

<p>In January, 1915,
the Kommandantur
drew up rules
for the granting of
passes, a fruitful
source of profit to
the Germans, and
of annoyance to
the population. A
scale of prices provided
even for the
shortest journeys.
Funeral processions
going to the South
Cemetery were also
required to have passes (free), to go through the Porte des Postes, and
were escorted by soldiers, both going and coming, to prevent the people from
leaving the ranks.</p>

</div>

<p>However, little by little, the people took up their occupations again.
Forty schools for boys and girls reopened early in November. Of the
remainder, five had been destroyed, two turned into hospitals and ten into
barracks. The higher
schools and, later, the
Lyc&eacute;e reopened, as did
also the Conservatoire,
whose pupils were
exempted from having
passes. The only newspapers
allowed were
the <cite>Bruxellois</cite> and the
<cite>Gazette des Ardennes</cite>,
both under German
control. On November
15th, 1915, at the request
of the Kommandantur, the
Municipality
started the bi-weekly
<cite>Bulletin de Lille</cite>, which
appeared on Thursdays
and Sundays, and contained
the Proclamations,
Birth and Death
notices, etc.</p>

<p>Next came the <strong>Requisitions</strong>:
saddles
and bridles, bicycles,
photographic apparatus,
telephones, bedding
and horsehair (photo
opposite). The Germans
relentlessly seized all
bedding, including
that of the old people,
some of whom died of
cold from sleeping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
bare stone floors. Neither sickness nor old age could soften them,
and when at last Lille was relieved, very few houses contained any
bedding.</p>

</div>


<h4>Famine</h4>

<p>The town now began to be threatened with <strong>famine</strong>. Since 1914, bread
had only contained one-third of wheat flour. At the request of the Military
Authorities, the Mayor sent an <strong>urgent appeal</strong> to Switzerland for help,
to save the women and children from starving, and cited the case of Strasburg
generously revictualled by her in 1870. In March, 1915, a <em>Commission
of Swiss Officers</em> visited Lille, but was unable to conclude arrangements.
On April 19th, after lengthy negotiations, the <em>Comit&eacute; National Belge</em>, under
the patronage of the <em>Ambassadors of the United States and Spain</em>, obtained
permission to revictual the famine-threatened town.</p>

<p>In the meantime, recourse was had to various expedients to eke out the
stocks of food. In December, wheat flour was mixed with rye, Indian corn
and rice. In April, potatoes were added. On the 11th, bread cards were
inaugurated, fixing the daily ration per head at 9 oz. The inhabitants
were divided into two classes, the ration being distributed every other
day.</p>

<h3>THE REIGN OF TERROR</h3>

<p><strong>Prohibitory Decrees</strong> followed in quick succession, in an endeavour to
terrorize the people, who were forbidden to possess arms, approach the
prisoners, import Belgian tobacco, or sell their wares in the streets, breaches
being punished often with vindictive severity. Two of the first <strong>victims</strong>
were the Prefect <em>(M. Tr&eacute;pont)</em> and his secretary <em>(M. Borrom&eacute;e)</em>, the former
accused of treason, the latter of stirring up revolt against the German
Authorities. Their "crime" was that, on August 24th, in conformity with
their duty, they had mobilized the French citizens, within sight of the enemy.
They were roughly handled at the time by the German soldiers, and would
probably have been shot, but for the intervention of one of the University
professors <em>(M. Piquet)</em>, who, acting as interpreter, managed to smooth
matters over. After being closely watched and spied on, they were <strong>arrested</strong>
on February 17th, 1915. M. Borrom&eacute;e was tried by Court-Martial on
March 13th, and sent to <strong>prison</strong> at Alrath. Nine months later (December
27th, 1915), his release was obtained through diplomatic representations.
The Prefect was sent as <strong>hostage</strong> first to Rastatt, then to Cellaschloss in
Hanover, and his liberation was only obtained on January 17th, 1916.</p>

<p>In April, 1915, a system of Roll Calls was inaugurated, to prepare the
way for the wholesale <strong>deportations</strong> which followed. At a given time and
place, the people were required to present themselves, with a small quantity
of baggage. Absentees were first fined, then imprisoned, the penalty
increasing in severity with each succeeding "offence."</p>

<p><strong>Domiciliary searches</strong> were carried out at all hours of the day and
night, for hidden soldiers, arms, carrier-pigeons, smuggled French newspapers,
and the like.</p>

<p>Then, as if fines, imprisonment and starving were not punishment enough,
the Germans started <strong>shooting</strong>.</p>

<h4>The Case of the Four</h4>

<p>When, on October 12th, 1914, the small garrison which was holding Lille,
surrendered, several hundred French soldiers escaped capture and hid
themselves in the town. Until evasion should be possible, it was necessary
to feed and shelter them, and this <em>M. Jacquet</em>, a wholesale wine merchant,
undertook to do. A good organizer, his coolness and courage fitted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
well for the task. He was assisted by his daughter <em>Genevi&egrave;ve</em> (who, later,
narrowly escaped being shot), his friends <em>Deconinck</em> and <em>Georges Maertens</em>
and a Belgian, <em>Sylv&egrave;re Verhulst</em>.</p>

<p>
My Beloved Wife and Children,<br />
</p>

<p>At the moment of starting for the place of execution, I tenderly embrace your dear
image for the last time. My last kiss, from the bottom of my heart, here for you.
Farewell! Long live France!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">E. Jacquet.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>On March 11th, 1915, a British aviator was forced to land in the town,
after having bombed a German telephone station. Hidden by Jacquet, he
eventually escaped to Belgium, guided by Melle. Genevi&egrave;ve. A few days
later, he again flew over the town and dropped notes reading as follows:
<em>"Lieutenant Mapplebeck sends his compliments to the Kommandant of the
German Forces in Lille, and regrets that he was unable to make his acquaintance
during his recent pleasant stay in the neighbourhood."</em></p>

<p>The joy of the inhabitants and the rage of the Kommandantur may be
better imagined than described in print. Orders were immediately given,
and the "Polizei" set to watch. Previously, on March 16th, notices had
been posted up all over the town, threatening with death any person who
should hide "any member of the enemy forces."</p>

<p><em>Hostages</em>, including the foremost persons in the town, were <strong>imprisoned</strong>
in the Citadelle, while the liberties of all were severely curtailed. Passes
to and from the surrounding villages were stopped, and "lights out" was
sounded at 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Being unable to imprison the entire population, the Kommandant
deprived them of <strong>liberty</strong> and <strong>air</strong> in mid-summer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <em>Jacquet</em>, who knew that he was suspected, made light of the
danger.</p>

<p><strong>Arrested</strong> several times under various pretences, all efforts to incriminate
him failed. However, a <strong>spy</strong> was at last found, who undertook to do the
business. Passing himself off as a French prisoner, he asked Jacquet and his
friends to help him, and then betrayed them to the "Polizei." A new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
search enabled the Germans to lay hands on 2,000 frs. in gold, but they could
not find any incriminating documents (the list of the soldiers in hiding, 200
in number, was in the upholstering of an armchair at Deconinck's house).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE MOAT OF
THE CITADELLE<br />
<em>where
M. Jacquet,
his friends,
and Trulin
were shot</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In consequence of the spy's information, Deconinck's house was watched.
Informed of the recent search of Jacquet's premises, Deconinck was looking
round for a safer hiding-place, when his next-door neighbour, who was in
the secret, suggested that the armchair would be safer in her keeping. The
offer was well-meant but unfortunate, as the Police, who were on the watch,
seized the chair, smashed it and found the list. Returning at once to Jacquet's
house, they arrested him and his daughter, and locked them up in the Citadelle.</p>

<p>At the same time, Deconinck, Maertens and Verhulst were arrested.</p>

<p>Jacquet's daughter, Melle. Genevi&egrave;ve, owed her life to lack of evidence.</p>

<p>The four men were tried on September 16th and sentenced to death.
They were shot on the morning of September 22nd, and died bravely, "standing,
their hands free, and their eyes unbandaged." Their last words, shouted
together, were: "Vive la France, Vive la R&eacute;publique." Their names are
inscribed on the Roll of Honour of the Army, and the <cite>Journal Officiel</cite> of
December 8th, 1918, announced that the Legion d'Honneur had been
conferred on M. Jacquet.</p>


<h4>Execution of L&eacute;on Trulin</h4>

<p>When the war broke out, L&eacute;on Trulin, a Belgian subject, aged 17, was
living at Lille. Intensely patriotic by nature, he burned to serve his country
against the hated invader. With the help of a few comrades, among whom
were <em>Raymond Derain</em> and <em>Marcel Gotti</em>, he got together various documents
and succeeded in bringing them to the Allies across the Dutch frontier. In
1915, he decided to go back to France and enlist in the Belgian Army, in
company with his friend Derain. On October 3rd they arrived at the frontier.
For three hours, in the dark, they burrowed under the "live" wire entanglements,
when suddenly the alarm was given. Lights flared up, shots were
fired, and Trulin and his companions were taken. The documents found on
Trulin proved to be his death warrant. His friends Derain and Gotti were
condemned to penal servitude for life.</p>

<p>On his way to the place of execution on November 8th, Trulin's nerve
(he was 18) gave way for a moment, but recovering himself quickly, he
walked to the post with a firm step, and so another name was added to the
long list of the victims of Kaiserism.</p>

<h4>The Explosion of the "Dix-huit Ponts"</h4>

<p>On January 11th, 1916, at about 2 o'clock in the morning, a terrific explosion
shook the town, hurling huge stones and d&eacute;bris in all directions for
a distance of several miles. An ammunition depot situated in the south-east
portion of the ramparts, between the Gates of Valenciennes and Douai,
about 400 yards distant from the railway station of St. Saviour, had blown
up. It was an enormous underground vault, commonly known as the "Dix-huit
Ponts," because of the 18 massive stone arches which formed the entrance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_b_022a.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"LILLE
IN TEARS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will probably never be known how many thousand shells and tons
of explosives blew up, as the greatest secrecy was observed by the German
Authorities. All the soldiers who
were there were killed. The damage
was tremendous, whole streets and
numerous factories, including two
large spinning-mills, were entirely
destroyed.</p>

<p>At the funeral, which took place
on Saturday, January 15th, 1916,
there were 108 coffins, but this figure
does not include the numerous
persons who were literally pulverized
by the explosion. The noise of the
latter was heard at <em>Breda</em> in <em>Holland</em>,
nearly a hundred miles away, and
houses as distant as the Rue Jeanne
d'Arc, Place Philippe le Bon and Rue
des Postes were destroyed by the
flying stones. In general, the catastrophe
was stoically borne by the
inhabitants, one citizen remarking:
"There were enough shells to have
massacred whole regiments. Better we
should mourn our dead, than the precious
lives of so many of our soldiers."</p>

<p>One huge stone, weighing more
than a ton, fell in the studio of the
sculptor Deplechin (Rue de Douai), Director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, who
carved the bas-relief <em>"Lille in Tears"</em> on it <em>(see Itinerary, p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, and photo
above)</em>.</p>


<h4>The Deportations</h4>

<p>In 1916, the prohibitions increased in number, the people being forbidden
to leave their houses after 6 p.m., or before 7 a.m.; to criticise the news
published by the authorities, to remain at their windows, or to stand on their
doorsteps, under a penalty of 5 to 10 days' imprisonment. They were also
forbidden to use the trams without a special permit. These measures paved
the way for the <strong>deportations</strong> of April-May, 1916. During Easter week,
under the pretence that the revictualling of the population was difficult, the
Governor decided to deport the inhabitants of Lille, Tourcoing and Roubaix
into the country, and make them cultivate the soil. Rumours to that effect
had been rife for several days previously, but the people would not believe
it. However, all doubts were cleared away on April 20th, when posters
warned the people to hold themselves in readiness with about 70 lbs.
of luggage. The 21st was a day of painful suspense. On the 22nd at
3 a.m., German soldiers hemmed in the Fives Quarter, and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<strong>machine-guns</strong> at the corners of the streets. House by house, street by
street, amid blows from the butt-ends of their rifles, the Germans forced the
people out of their houses. They were counted like cattle, and the number
checked with the sheet posted up on each house. Those who were to go,
mostly girls, were forcibly taken from their parents and led away between
fixed bayonets, then loaded into cattle-trucks and sent to an unknown
fate. Girls were taken from mothers and wives from husbands, with coldblooded
indifference. It was in vain that the Mayor and the Bishop indignantly
protested, the former to the Kommandantur and the latter from
the pulpit. Methodically, this abomination was perpetrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_b_023a.jpg" width="700" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE H&Ocirc;TEL-DE-VILLE
BURNING<br />
<em>on the night
of April 24th,
1916</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>For ten days the people lived in mortal suspense, asking themselves if
and when their turn would come.</p>

<p>On Easter-Sunday night, the 64th German Infantry Regiment surrounded
the Vauban Quarter, the horror of the scene being intensified by the H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville
in flames.</p>

<p>Each night, until April 30th, 1,800 to 2,000 persons were wrested from
their homes.</p>

<p>Although greatly depressed, the deported people recovered their courage
as the trains left the station, and to the amazement of the Germans sang
the <em>"Marseillaise"</em> in a mighty chorus.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand persons, mostly women and children, were forcibly
taken from their homes and made to cultivate the soil, break stones, build
bridges, make sand-bags, turn shells, etc., their only food consisting of a
little black "bread," nauseating soup and broken scraps of meat.</p>

<p>As soon as the French Government learned the facts, a Note was sent
to the Neutral Powers, protesting against these inhuman deportations,
which were ordered by <em>General Von Graevenitz</em>, and executed by the 64th
Infantry Regiment, commanded by <em>Captain Himmel</em>.</p>

<p>Five months later, thanks to the intervention of the King of Spain,
Alfonso XIII., these unfortunate people were allowed to go back to their
homes.</p>

<p>For several months in 1917 things went better, but in 1918, the German
Authorities recommenced deporting. A first batch of men and women
was interned at Holzminden, while on another occasion the women were
sent to Holzminden and the men to Jewie, near Vilna (Lithuania). The
Official Records, to which the reader is referred, contain full details of these
inhuman crimes and of the abominable treatment to which the exiles were
subjected: privations of every kind, humiliation, torture and degrading
occupations.</p>

</div>

<p>On September 30th, 1918, the Kommandantur ordered the evacuation
of all males from 15 to 60 years of age, but the German soldiers carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
their instructions in a half-hearted
way, and many escaped. The approaching
sound of the guns and
the lax discipline of the soldiers
announced the Allies' Great Victory
and the coming deliverance
to the war-weary people.</p>

<p>On October 17th, the British
troops entered Lille.</p>


<h4>The Ruined Industries of
Northern France</h4>

<p>Before the war, Northern
France was one of the most
flourishing industrial centres in
the country.</p>

<p>The metallurgical firms of
the North produced annually
over a million tons of <strong>steel</strong>,
representing nearly a quarter
of the country's total production.
This steel was transformed
locally into finished articles. The
exceedingly prosperous <strong>textile</strong>
industry was carried on mainly at Tourcoing, Roubaix, Rheims and Sedan.</p>

<p>The <strong>flax</strong> industry was also concentrated around Armenti&egrave;res, Lille and
Halluin.</p>

<p>The <strong>cotton</strong> mills of Roubaix, Tourcoing and Lille were extremely prosperous
and important.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/i_b_024b.jpg" width="427" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>TRULIN'S
GRAVE<br />
<em>in the East
Cemetery</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The following general figures give an idea of the industrial importance of
this region, which contributed one-sixth of the country's total taxes. Before the
war, the annual industrial production
was estimated at 4,000,000,000
frs., of which the textile industries
accounted for 2,500,000,000 frs.</p>

<p>The industries of Northern
France have been <strong>ruined</strong>, not
so much by the war, as by the
systematic <strong>pillaging</strong> and <strong>destructions</strong>
carried out by the
Germans.</p>

<p>Official documents left behind
in Brussels by the routed enemy
brought to light the existence of
two German Organizations: the
<strong>"Abbau Konzern"</strong> and the
<strong>"Wumba Waffen und Munitions-Beschaffungs
Anstalt."</strong>
The mission of the <strong>former</strong> was to
cripple France industrially, by
methodically destroying her factories
and mills, while the <strong>latter's</strong>
agreeable and profitable task was
to sell stolen French machinery
and tools to competitive German
industrial concerns.</p>

<h4>The Grande Place</h4>

<p>In the centre of the Square is a fluted Granite <strong>Column</strong> by <em>Benvignat</em>,
erected in 1848 to commemorate the <em>Siege of Lille</em> in 1792. At the top is a
<strong>statue</strong> of <em>Jeanne Maillotte</em> holding a lighted torch in her hand. During
the siege of the town in 1792, she crossed the enemy lines and set fire to
the Austrian batteries which were shelling the town. The name of this
heroic woman was given to one of the streets, in which a later hero, M. Eug&egrave;ne
Jacquet, lived <em>(see p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>)</em>. The inhabitants have surnamed the statue
<em>"The Goddess."</em></p>

shape, it stands between the Grande Place, Rue des Sept-Agaches, Place
du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre and Rue des Manneliers. Rising above the roof is a polygonal
turret, the upper part of which forms a terrace with small timber-work
campanile. It has been restored in recent times.</p>

<h4>The "Bourse"</h4>

<p>The Bourse is the finest specimen of 17th century Flemish architecture
in France. Dissatisfied with transacting their business in the open, twenty-four
merchants of Lille petitioned the King of Spain, Philippe IV., for permission
to erect a building in the Place du Grand March&eacute;, to be known as
the "Bourse."</p>

<p>The plans of the architect <em>Julien Destr&eacute;</em> were accepted in 1652. It was
stipulated in the specification that the fa&ccedil;ades should be "of like symmetry
and construction," that only the armorial bearings of the King were to
appear over the entrances, and that the twenty-four buildings composing
the edifice should be beneath one continuous roof, so as to form a harmonious
whole. The petitioners were to guarantee the completion of the building
within a given space of time.</p>

<p>To-day, shops on the ground-floor hide part of the fa&ccedil;ade, so that it is
difficult to distinguish the bossages and semi-circular tympanums, but the
rich, severe ornamentation of the upper stories, composed of caryatids,
pilasters, pediments, and garlands carved in the stone-work, is plainly
visible. The different periods of life (childhood, youth, and old-age) and the
passions are depicted. The head of King Midas with stellated crown is
especially noteworthy. A judicious use of brick with stone, while ensuring
a harmonious <em>ensemble</em>, reposing to the view, also causes the relief motifs
to stand out well.</p>

<p>Of the four doors ornamented with scroll-work, horns of plenty and
royal coats of arms, in the four sides of the edifice, one gives access to the
interior courtyard which is lined with four wide arcaded galleries. Doric
columns of polished black stone support the vaulting, which is of brick,
with binding ribs and nerves of white stone. On the plinth are heads of
leopards connected by garlands of flowers and foliage. A bronze <strong>statue</strong>
by Lemaire, representing Emperor <em>Napol&eacute;on I.</em>, protector of the national
industries, stands in the middle of the courtyard. This statue was inaugurated
in 1854, and was cast from old presses from the Mint of Lille,
which had previously been made from guns taken at Austerlitz.</p>

<p>The interior galleries of the Bourse were decorated in 1850.</p>

<p>Facing each of the bays formed by the intercolumniations are large
tablets of marble surrounded by carvings, which recall those of the fa&ccedil;ade.
In the midst of this sculpture are the symbols of commerce, industry and
science. Inscriptions recall the most important dates and institutions
relating to the commerce and industry of Lille. The busts over them represent
great inventors or learned men (Jacquart, Philippe de Girard, Chaptal,
Brongniart, Chevreul).</p>

<p><em>On leaving the Bourse, cross the square to the left, and enter the Place de
Rihour.</em></p>

<p>At the corner of the Grand Place, the black fa&ccedil;ade of the <strong>Grand' Garde</strong>
decorated with trophies and curved pediments bearing the arms of France
and Lille, should be noticed. A large shell-hole in the left-hand pediment
has been temporarily bricked up.</p>

<h4>The Palais de Rihour</h4>

<p>Built in 1457-1462, this palace was the residence of <em>Philippe le Bon</em>,
Duke of Burgundy. Only an octagonal turret, the guard-room and the
chapel of brick and white stone remain. The H&ocirc;tel de Ville was erected
on its site.</p>

<p>The low guard-room, in which the town records are kept, is divided
in the middle by three polygonal columns unequally interspaced. The
stone staircase with ribbed vaulting and graceful ornamentation, was formerly
the grand staircase. Transferred to its present position, it now leads to
the chapel known as the "Salle du Conclave," where the magistrates of
Lille sat until 1789.</p>

<p>To the right of the chapel is a brick building, the fa&ccedil;ade of which is divided
by two similar gables. Jutting out at the corner is an octagonal turret
containing two small vaulted chambers. Above is a third room with
timber-work ceiling, known as the "Oratory of the Duchess." An opening
in the wall communicates with the chapel, and through it the choir is visible.
From this room, which is reached by a spiral staircase of stone inside the
turret, it is possible to hear the service without being seen.</p>

CHURCH</p></div>
</div>

<p>The church was seriously
damaged by the bombardment
of October 1914, which set fire
to the roof.</p>

<p>It is a curious specimen of
the 15th century Gothic-Flamboyant
style of Walloon-Flanders,
and comprises five naves
of equal height arranged quincuncially,
whereas most of the
churches belonging to that period
have three naves under a single
roof, the aisles being shorter
than the great nave, while
the tower is necessarily
placed over the main entrance <em>(see St. Catherine's Church, p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>It also contains an ambulatory and an apse formed by polygonal
chapels.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ST. MAURICE'S
CHURCH:
THE NAVE</p></div>
</div>

<p>The fa&ccedil;ade, with its three portals, steeples of open construction, and
white stone tower at the entrance, dates from the second half of the 19th
century. The old square tower was pulled down in 1826 as unsafe. These
different alterations were carried out under the direction of the architect
<em>Lannissie</em>. According to <em>Monseigneur Dehaisnes</em>, the remarkable exterior
of this church is due to these
successive restorations and
alterations.</p>

<p>Inside the church are rows
of round slender columns with
sculptured capitals, irregularly
spaced.</p>

<p>The springing of the binding
ribs or projecting arches
which line the vaults, and their
graceful arched branches, rest
on and meet at the capitals.
The point of intersection of
the arches is marked by a pendant
keystone. High and broad
mullioned windows (note the
stone uprights dividing the
bays) amply light the interior.
In the choir aisles are the following
<strong>paintings</strong>: St. Charles
Borrom&eacute;e and St. Francis, by
<em>Van Oost</em>, and "Les Disciples
d'Emma&uuml;s," by <em>Van der Burgh</em>;
in the chapel of St. Barbara:
"Vision de St&eacute;. Therese," by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<em>Van Oost</em> and a landscape by <em>Van der Burgh</em>; in the chapel of the Virgin:
"Mariage de la Vierge," by <em>Wamps</em>, "Glorification de la Vierge," by <em>Van

the plans of the
architect <em>Matteau</em>.
The walls
have been deeply
scarred in places
by shell splinters
<em>(note the white
patches on the
blackened fa&ccedil;ade)</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Palais des
Beaux-Arts</strong> was
inaugurated in
1892.</p>

<p>Composite in
style, it is very
richly ornamented.
Flanked by two
round pavilions
with cupolas containing
staircases,
its principal fa&ccedil;ade is in the Rue de la R&eacute;publique. The <strong>Museum of Lille</strong>
is installed there.</p>


<h4>THE MUSEUM OF LILLE</h4>

<p>This is one of the finest provincial museums in France. As early as 1795
it contained 183 works of art. A Consular Decree, dated the 14th Fructidor,
Year IX, added 46 paintings taken from the collections of the Louvre and
Versailles. The first catalogue, dated 1850, comprised 274 works of art, which
number had increased to 1,275 at the time of the inventory of January 1st,
1908.</p>


<h5>The Museum during the War</h5>

<p>The Museum was the edifice which most suffered from the German bombardments.
On October 11th, 1914, it was struck by 75 shells. The curator
took measures at once to have the roof repaired and protect the collections.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_b_038b.jpg" width="700" height="518" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE BELLE
JARDINI&Eacute;RE,<br />
<em>near the
Museum
(Boulevard
de la Libert&eacute;)</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>However, the Museum was not proof against German greed. On Saturday,
November 17th, two officers, accompanied by military policemen, came to
"requisition" the works of art, in the name of the German authorities.
After visiting the
different rooms, and
being unable to obtain
the keys of the
cabinets, they broke
open the latter and
took all the medals
and miniatures,
which they placed
in paper bags from
a neighbouring
grocer's shop. The
curator protested the
same day, both verbally
and in writing,
to the Kommandantur
and
Military Governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The miniatures were brought back on November 19th, and the medals
on December 3rd, less various antique gold jewels, two miniatures, and two
gold medals, which had been "lost."</p>

<p>Later, two well-known German art experts <em>Herr Demmler</em> and <em>Herr Professor
Klemen</em>, armed with carefully annotated catalogues, made a general
"requisition" comprising: 1,500 drawings (including those by Raphael
and Michael Angelo), 420 paintings and 518 other works of art, all of which
were packed up, labelled and sent off. The famous <em><strong>"Wax Head"</strong> (page <a href="#Page_43">43</a>)</em>
had, however, been hidden away in an underground vault, and replaced by a
copy.</p>

<p>In an endeavour to justify their action, the Germans sent out a radiogram
on November 4th, 1918, stating that the Museum of Lille had been damaged
so seriously as to be unsafe for works of art, and that at the request of the
curator, an inventory of the collections had been made and the latter transferred
first to Valenciennes and then to the Old Museum in Brussels.</p>


<h4>VISIT TO THE MUSEUM</h4>

<p>The collections are classed under four distinct heads: <strong>paintings</strong>, <strong>modern
sculpture</strong>, <strong>archeological and lapidary specimens</strong> and the <strong>Wicar collections</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Flemish</strong> and <strong>French</strong> schools are the best represented. <em>(For a
detailed description of the paintings, see "La peinture au Mus&eacute;e de Lille,"
by Fran&ccedil;ois Benoit</em>, 3 vols. <em>in 4to,
with reproductions</em>, 1908).</p>

<p>The <strong>Spanish</strong> school includes a
St. Jerome, by <em>Ribera</em>, dated 1643.</p>

<p>The <strong>Italian</strong> school contains
The Martyrdom of St. George by
<em>Veronese</em> (duplicate of the painting
by <em>San Giorgio Maggiore</em> at Verona);
two circular panels: Eloquence
and Science (symbolized by two
Venetian women with auburn
hair), also by Veronese; The Flight
into Egypt by <em>Carlo Saraceni</em>, and
the Assumption of the Virgin by
<em>Piazzetta</em> (two very original painters
little known in France); a
delicate "Virgin with wild roses,"
of exquisite colouring, by <em>Ridolfo
Ghirlandajo</em>; "Magdalene at the
feet of Christ" and a "Judith and
Holopherne" by <em>Lambert Zustris</em>
(often called Lambert Lambard)&mdash;two
paintings of limpid colouring; (note the delicate lilac-grey
tints).</p>

<p>As befits the "Capital of
Flanders," the <strong>Flemish</strong> and <strong>Dutch</strong> Schools of the North are fully represented.</p>

FROM THE
CROSS,<br />
<em>by Rubens
(Clich&eacute; LL.)</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Mystic Press, by <em>Jean Bellegambe</em>; the triptych, Virgin surrounded
by Angels, attributed to <em>Gerard David</em>; the first portrait of Philippe le Bon,
attributed to <em>Pierre Etret</em>; the Symbolical
Fountain, an exceedingly fine
altar-screen panel by <em>Thierry Bouts</em> de
Haarlem, is particularly noteworthy;
a portrait of Emperor Charles Quint at
the age of 32, by <em>Christophe Amberger</em>
and Charles Quint taking the Monk's
Gown, by <em>Nicolas Francken the Elder</em>.
<em>Rubens</em> is represented by seven paintings:
The Descent from the Cross, of
admirable clearness; the expression
is more natural than that of the painting
in Antwerp; Vision of the Virgin
appearing to St. Francis, of warm
colouring; St. Bonaventure Meditating,
and St. Francis receiving the Stigmas
(two fine long panels); The Death of
Magdalene (a somewhat monotonous
but strangely intense monochrome).
<em>Van Dyck</em> is well represented by the
following: The Crucifixion, considered
by Paul de St. Victor to be his greatest
masterpiece (the figure of Christ stands
out clearly against a cloudy sky pierced by lightning); Portraits of an Old
Lady and Marie de M&eacute;dicis (in the background are seen Antwerp and the
Escaut). The following artists are also represented: <em>Jordaens</em>, by the
Prodigal Son, Christ and the Pharisees, the Temptation, and a wonderful
study of cows; <em>Gaspard de Crayer</em>, by Martyrs buried alive (fine harmonious
composition); <em>F. Franchoys</em>, by a Portrait of the Prior of the Abbey of
Tongerloo, Gisherts Mutsarts, dated 1645. (Paintings by this artist are
exceedingly rare). <em>Verspronck</em>, by the Portrait of Young Boy; <em>Jansen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Van Ceulen</em>, by a very fine portrait of Anne Marie de Schurmann; <em>Pieter
Codde</em>, by Conversation, of delightful colouring.</p>

<p>The <strong>French</strong> school, although incomplete (<em>Prudhon</em>, <em>Ingres</em> and <em>Antoine
Watteau</em> are not represented), is nevertheless rich and instructive. First
of all an <em>anonymous</em> 17th century Portrait of an Architect, whose pale harsh
face arrests the attention and haunts the memory. <em>Ph. de Champaigne</em>
is represented by the Good Shepherd; <em>Restout</em> by a Jesus at Emma&uuml;s;
<em>Mignard</em>, by A Judgment by Midas; <em>Largilli&egrave;re</em>, by a very fine portrait
of his father-in-law, the painter, John Forest; <em>Douv&eacute;</em> (native of Lille), by
a fine portrait of the painter Savage; <em>Jean Voilles</em>, by a delightful portrait
of Madame Li&eacute;nard; <em>Fran&ccedil;ois Watteau</em> (grand nephew of Antoine Watteau),
by two amusing sketches: Procession of our Lady of the Vine in 1789 and
The Old Clothes Market of Lille; <em>David</em>, by his first picture after returning
from Rome, "B&eacute;lisaire" (1781), of which there is a reduced copy in the
Louvre (this painting marks the re-birth of the antique); <em>Boilly</em>, a native
of the district of Lille, is fully represented by his Triumph of Marat&mdash;masterpiece
of great truth and delicacy&mdash;and 28 portraits of artists painted for
the picture "R&eacute;union d'artistes dans l'atelier d'Isabey." The following
are the names of these portraits: <em>Van Dael</em>, flower painter; <em>Houdon</em>, sculptor

<div class="caption"><p>MEDEA
KILLING HER
CHILDREN<br /><br />
<em>by Delacroix
(Clich&eacute; LL.)</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the <strong>modern</strong> school, the following are especially noteworthy: La
Med&eacute;e, by <em>Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix</em> (strikingly dramatic), L'apr&egrave;s-diner &agrave; Ornans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
by <em>Courbet</em>, the colouring of which is unfortunately fading; La Becqu&eacute;e,
charming genre painting by <em>Millet</em>; Effet du Matin, by <em>Corot</em>, remarkable
for its beautiful effects of silvery light.</p>


<h5>II.&mdash;Sculpture</h5>

<p>Of the collections of sculpture, only
the fine <strong>bust</strong> of Bonaparte by <em>Corbet</em>,
dated 1799, is worthy of special
mention.</p>


<h5>III.&mdash;Archeological and Lapidary
Museum</h5>

<p>The Archeological Museum contains
the following remarkable works of art:
Three 14th century <strong>statuettes</strong> of the
Virgin (two of wood, one of marble);
an ivory <strong>diptych</strong> of the Crucifixion;
a 13th century <strong>reliquary cross</strong> of
Flemish origin; divers curious specimens
of <strong>brass-work</strong>, including the Censer of
Lille, rightly considered a masterpiece;
a richly embroidered <strong>altar-cloth</strong>, representing
the Annunciation.</p>


<h5>IV.&mdash;The Wicar Collections</h5>

<p>The important Wicar Collections
were bequeathed by the Lille painter,
<em>Jean Baptist Wicar</em>, pupil of David (1762-1834), who in 1815 succeeded in
protecting the Museum of Lille from spoliation by the Allies.</p>

<p>Commissary to Bonaparte in Italy, and later Director of the Royal Academy
at Naples, Wicar adopted Roman nationality, and collected a large number
of fine drawings and art treasures. Parts of his collections are
to-day at Oxford. The famous "Wax Head" <em>(p. <a href="#Page_43">43</a>)</em> is in the centre of the
Wicar Room.</p>

<p>There are several <strong>Renaissance bronzes</strong> worthy of note, also a <strong>marble
bas-relief</strong> by Donatello, representing the Beheading of John the Baptist,
and a fine terra-cotta <strong>Head of Child</strong> by Verrochio. The drawings merit
careful inspection. The following are especially remarkable: Studies on
pink and yellow grounds, by <em>Filippo Lippi</em>, <em>Filippino</em>, <em>Ghirlandaio</em>, and
<em>La Verrochio</em>; Head of Bald Man, by <em>Montegna</em>; 14 drawings on parchment,
representing scenes from the Metamorphoses, Children's Games and Arabesques,
attributed by L. Gonse to <em>Jacopo Francia</em>, attest marvellous delicacy
and skill; two sheets of caricatures by <em>Leonard de Vinci</em> and 60 sketches by
<em>Raphael</em>; studies in black and red by <em>Michael Angelo</em>, especially a Dead
Christ, figure of a naked man, fantastic masks and a series of 184 architectural
drawings, generally known as the "Book of Michael Angelo." <em>Annibal
Carrache</em>, <em>Le Guide</em>, <em>Guerchin</em>, <em>Sodoma</em> and <em>Andr&eacute; del Sarto</em> are also well represented.</p>

<p>On the other hand, French drawings are few in number, the most remarkable
being one by <em>David</em> for his "Serment des Horaces." The others
include: "Le Corps de Garde," by <em>Boilly</em> (fine, carefully-finished drawing);
a naked Woman, by <em>Watteau</em>; two drawings by <em>Ingres</em> for his "Apotheose
d'Hom&egrave;re;" a drawing by <em>Poussin</em> for the "Massacre des Innocents";
a wonderful Portrait of Old Man, by <em>Lagneau</em>, an artist little known in the
reign of Louis XIII, but a great master; lastly a fascinating fusain drawing
by <em>Millet</em>: "Le Troupeau de Moutons an milieu d'un bois."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<h5>The "Wax Head"</h5>

<p>The most celebrated work of art in the collections is the <strong>Wax Head</strong>
(T&ecirc;te de Cire), which has so often been reproduced in engravings, photographs
and casts. This funeral souvenir, which stands in a golden niche
in the middle of a room draped with red plush, was made to perpetuate the
memory of a young girl 15 to 18 years of age. The pedestal and draperies
are of terra-cotta, and date from the 18th century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/i_b_043a.jpg" width="505" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE
WAX HEAD<br />
<em>(Clich&eacute; LL.)</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Of Italian origin, the head is attributed by some to Raphael, by others
to Leonard de Vinci. The possibility of its being antique is no longer admitted.
According to Gonse, it came from the Tuscan studio of Orsino
Benitendi, and dates from about 1480. The wax was tinted at a later date.</p>

<p>Leaning to one side, the face is pensive in expression. The neck is flexible
and sits with easy grace on the shoulders. The cheeks are rather broad
and somewhat flat, the chin round and short. A faint smile hovers round
the delicate mouth. The eyes are considered by some to be rather small.
The waving hair is divided into two graceful masses, which are rolled up
on the back of the neck.</p>

<p>The expression of the face is enigmatical and changes with the angle from
which it is regarded. Psychologists and artists alike will long discuss its
charms.</p>

<p>When the two German experts <em>Herr Demmler</em> and <em>Herr Professor Klemen</em>
"requisitioned" the collections of the Museum <em>(p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>)</em>, what they took away
was a <em>copy</em> of this head, the original having been hidden in one of the underground
vaults. It narrowly escaped destruction in October, 1918, when the
Germans, previous to evacuating the town, cut the water-mains, so that
the sub-basement of the Museum was flooded. Fortunately, the water
did not rise high enough to do serious damage, and the head was eventually
restored intact to its velvet pedestal.</p>

<p><em>Near the Museum, at the corner of the Rue Jeanne Maillotte and the Rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Denis Godefroy which opens on the Boulevard de la Libert&eacute;, in line with the

<h5>The Paris Gate</h5>

<p>This gate was built in 1685-1695 from the plans of a local architect (Simon
Vollant), to commemorate the return of Lille to France (1667). It
was completely restored in 1895. The demolition of the old line of fortifications
left this gate isolated in the middle of the town, and it was to ornament
and finish off those portions which adjoined the ramparts that additions
in the same style were then made. The whole forms a Monumental Gate
and Triumphal Arch.</p>

<p>In a large semi-circular arch is the Royal Coat of Arms, while below are
the Arms of Lille carved on a stone tablet. On either side of the latter are
channels for receiving the drawbridge levers.</p>

<p>To the right and left, two Doric columns on pedestals support the whole
of the entablature with frieze and cornice, above which are trophies, helmets
and flags. On pedestals between the columns are statues of Hercules
<em>(on the right)</em> and Mars <em>(on the left)</em>, while above are sculptured motifs in demi-relief.</p>

<p>The most remarkable part of the monument is the great sculptured motif
which crowns the whole. In the middle, Victory seated amidst arms and
standards, raises her right hand to crown the King (Louis XIV), seen in the
medallion immediately below. At Victory's feet, somewhat to the right
and left, two figures of Fame proclaim the glory on trumpets.</p>

<p>The whole is expressive and graceful, attesting the great ability of the
artist in treating this somewhat commonplace theme.</p>

<p><em>Take the Rue Carnot to the right of the Gate, skirting the Square Ruault,
which is the continuation, as far as the <strong>Hospital of St. Saviour</strong>.</em></p>

<div class="caption"><p>HOSPITAL OF
SAINT-SAVIOUR<br />
<em>Door in

</div>

<p>This hospital, sometimes known as that of St. John the Evangelist, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
founded in 1216, after
the battle of Bouvines,
by the Countess
Jeanne de Constantinople.
The present
brick and stone buildings
date from the
17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<p>In the Middle-Ages,
hospital wards
contained an altar
at one end, so that
the patients could
hear Mass from their
beds. A heavy curtain
was then drawn,
cutting off the altar
from the remainder of
the room.</p>

<p>In the hospital of
St. Saviour, the choir
of the chapel, which
is lighted by high,
broken-arch windows,
still exists. A low, vaulted room, opening on the right, serves as an
oratory for the nuns.</p>

<p><em>Skirting the Hospital on the right, the tourist comes to the <strong>Noble Tower</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Built in 1459, the Noble Tower was formerly the centre of the town's
defences. It consisted originally of three stories, one of which contained
ribbed Gothic vaulting. Of great size and massive construction, the tower
is flanked by two smaller ones connected by a curtain. The upper portion
of the tower has disappeared.</p>

<p>Near by is seen the steeple of the <strong>church of St. Saviour</strong>, a modern,
pseudo-Byzantine edifice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The temporary bridges mentioned further on, existed in April, 1919.
In whatever state the tourist may find them, he need only <em>follow the Deule
canal, after the <strong>Jardin Vauban</strong>, cross the first bridge he meets, and turn back
to the left (if necessary) on the other side, until he comes to the avenue which opens
out on the right opposite the Boulevard de la Libert&eacute;, and which leads to the
<strong>Citadelle</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Leave the Grande Place by the Rue Nationale, following the latter as far
as the church of the Sacred Heart</em>, whose high unfinished tower will be seen
on the right. <em>To the right is the <strong>Jussieu Square</strong></em> (landscape garden laid
out by Barillet in the moats of the old fortifications), at the entrance to
which is a <strong>monument</strong> to the local poet and song-writer <strong>Desrousseaux</strong>
(photo opposite), who started his
career (1820-1892) as a simple
working-man, and whose dialect
songs are still sung. At
the foot of the monument is
the figure of a young mother
rocking her child to sleep, recalling
the composer's most
popular song; <i lang="fr">"Dors, min p'tit
quinquin."</i></p>

<p><em>Cross the Boulevard de la
Libert&eacute;, then skirt the <strong>Testelin
Monument</strong>. M. Testelin</em> was
Prefect of the North of France
and "Organizer of National
Defence in the North in 1870-1871."
The monument bears
traces of the bombardment,
while the bronze statues which
surrounded the pedestal were
carried away by the Germans.</p>

<p><em>On reaching the <strong>Church
of the Sacred Heart</strong>, turn to
the right and follow the Rue
de Solf&eacute;rino to the Boulevard
Vauban, on the right of which is the <strong>Palais Rameau</strong>.</em></p>


<h4>The Palais Rameau</h4>

<div class="caption"><p>THE
PALAIS
RAMEAU.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This fairly large building was erected in 1878, with the financial help
of an agriculturist named <em>Rameau</em>. The principal hall is used for exhibitions,
more especially horticultural. The rather <strong>curious fa&ccedil;ade</strong> includes
a <strong>bust of Rameau</strong> flanked by
figures of the goddesses Flora
(flowers) and Pomona (fruits).
In the rear of the Palace Garden
is a fine circular <strong>conservatory</strong>.</p>

<p><em>On leaving the Palais, take
on the right the Boulevard Vauban
which, a little further on, crosses
the <strong>Jardin Vauban</strong></em> (pretty
public garden), leading
to the <strong>Canal de la Moyenne
Deule</strong>.</p>

<p>Skirting a portion of the
Citadelle and continuing the
canal of the Haute Deule, this
canal connects Lille with la
Bass&eacute;e and Douai. The river
Deule was first opened up to
navigation in 1271, while in 1830
its sidings were improved and the
water-way deepened.</p>

<p>In April, 1919, it was necessary
to follow the Deule as far
as the Square du Ramponneau,
where a temporary wooden bridge had been built close to a half-destroyed
foot-bridge. After crossing the bridge, visitors had to come back to the left
as far as the first avenue on the right leading to the Citadelle <em>(see p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>)</em>.</p>

<h4>The Citadelle</h4>

<p>This masterpiece of the fortification art is the work of Vauban (17th
century). In shape a regular pentagon, it includes numerous detached
out-works. Entrance to it is gained through the Royal Gate, which dates
from 1670 <em>(photo above)</em>. It contains barracks and a chapel (photo below),
and it was in the latter that the hostages of Lille spent their nights during
the German occupation <em>(p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Jacquet</strong>, <strong>Deconinck</strong>, <strong>Maertens</strong>, <strong>Verhulst</strong> and <strong>Trulin</strong> were shot in the
northern moats by the Germans <em>(p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>)</em>.</p>

<p><em>After visiting the Citadelle, re-cross the bridge, turn to the left and follow
the <strong>Fa&ccedil;ade de l'Esplanade</strong>, fine avenue planted with linden-trees, which runs

<p><em>Further on in the Rue Royale, after the
Banque de France, in a small street on
the right, is the Church of St. Catherine
(photo below).</em></p>


<h4>Church of St. Catherine</h4>

<p>Like many Flemish churches, that of
St. Catherine has no transept, and consists
of three practically identical naves.
Standing out from the fa&ccedil;ade, a large
square tower, flanked at the corners by
eight buttresses, supports the ancient
timber-work <strong>belfry</strong>&mdash;one of the finest
in the region. The bell-chamber is
lighted by broken-arch bays. One of the
heavy bells (1403) bears a curious <strong>inscription</strong>
in rhymes. Below the tower is the
great doorway.</p>

<p>The exterior decoration is very sober
in style. The right-hand side of the
building is masked by houses. The left
fa&ccedil;ade, between whose high mullioned
windows are buttresses decorated with small ornamental arcades, has been
restored in modern times. Belts of foliage run round the gutters of the roof.
The carvings on the great and small doorways are modern.</p>

<p>Inside the church are two rows of columns on moulded bases, the corbels
of whose capitals are ornamented with foliage. The nerves of the vaulting
are plaster.</p>

<h4>THE OLD TOWN</h4>

<p><em>Chief Buildings</em>: The <strong>Church of Our Lady of the Vine</strong>; <strong>Comtesse
Hospital</strong>, <strong>Law Courts</strong>, <strong>Church of St. Magdalene</strong>, <strong>H&ocirc;tel des Canonniers</strong>,
<strong>Roubaix Gate</strong>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Starting from the Grande Place, cross the Place du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre and take the
Rue de la Grande Chauss&eacute;e, on the left of the Nouvelle Bourse</em>: 13th and 14th
century houses at Nos. 11, 14, 15, 42 and 52. <em>On the right take the Rue des
Chats Bossus and Place du Lion d'or, leave the Place St. Martin on the right,
and take the Rue de la Monnaie on the left.</em> At No. 31 in this street, opens a
narrow passage leading to the <strong>Church of Our Lady of the Vine</strong>, which
is being erected on the site of the Castle of Buc. When finished, it will
be one of the largest of modern Gothic churches. The inhabitants of Lille
have already surnamed it "the Cathedral." Building was begun in 1855,
from plans by the English architects Clutton and Burges, revised by the
Jesuit, Arthur Martin. 13th century in style, the choir, over crypt, is only
half-finished, while the remainder of the edifice has not yet been begun.</p>

<p>In the chapel of the apse, over the altar, is a <strong>statue</strong> of Our Lady of the
Vine, venerated since the 13th century as the Patron Saint of the town.
In a chapel on the left are <strong>plans</strong> and a <strong>model in relief</strong> of the finished
basilica.</p>

<p><em>Return to the Rue de la Monnaie</em>, at No. 32 of which is the <strong>Comtesse
Hospital</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Comtesse Hospital</strong> was founded in 1243 by Countess Jeanne de
Flandre; the entrance dates from 1649, and opens on to a curious vaulted
passage. A 15th century gable faces the Rue Comtesse.</p>

<p>Inside are <strong>paintings</strong> by <em>Arnould de Vuez</em> and <em>Wamps</em>. The chapel
contains fine <strong>timber-work vaulting</strong> and a <strong>commemorative tablet</strong>
inscribed with the names of the French officers who died in this hospital
of wounds received at the Battle of Fontenoy.</p>

<p><em>Follow the Rue de la Monnaie as far as the Place du Concert. Turn
to the right as far as the Canal de la Basse Deule</em>, by the side of which is the
<strong>Colonnade</strong> of the Law Courts (1837) <em>(photo below)</em>.</p>

<p>The Deule is an important river about 40 miles long, which traverses
the whole of the coalfields of Northern France, and helps to carry the enormous
traffic connected with the metallurgical, cotton, woollen and sugar industries
of that region.</p>

<p><em>Follow the Deule Quay to the left, to the steps of the Pont Neuf. (If motoring
or driving, the tourist will have to go via the Place du Concert, Rue St. Andr&eacute;,
then taking on the right the Rue du Pont Neuf.)</em> The latter crosses the Deule
by the <strong>Grand Pont</strong> or <strong>Pont Neuf</strong>, formerly called the Pont Royal. Built
in 1701 from plans by the architect Vollant, this bridge connects up the two
parallel roads which run alongside the canal. Originally it was composed
of six arches, two of which spanned the river, the other four passing over
the low-level roads on either bank.</p>

<p>To allow the trams to pass, the two arches on the quay where the
colonnade of the Palais de Justice stands have been replaced in recent
times by an unartistic platform resting on iron pillars, which has spoilt the
appearance of the bridge.</p>

<p>Steps connect the bridge with the quays.</p>

</div>

<p><em>After crossing the bridge, the tourist arrives in front of the <strong>Church of
St. Magdalene</strong> (1675)</em>, a vast round edifice surrounded by chapels and
surmounted by a cupola. It contains several interesting <strong>paintings</strong>:
on the High Altar, the Resurrection of Lazarus, by <em>Jacques Van Oost</em>; under
the dome, The Four Doctors of the Latin Church, by the same painter;
in the Chapel of Our Lady of Help, The Adoration of the Shepherds, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>

Bluets. At the lower end of this
square, turn to the left into the
Rue des Urbanistes, then take the
first street on the right, the Rue des
Canonniers, which skirts the <strong>H&ocirc;tel
des Canonniers</strong>. The latter</em>,
formerly an Urbanist Convent,
was given by <span class="smcap">Napol&eacute;on</span> in 1804
to the "Sedentary Gunners Corps"
of Lille. It contains town records
and a small museum of local
interest.</p>

<p>A little further on, at the corner of the Rue des Canonniers and the Rue
de Roubaix is the old <strong>H&ocirc;tel d'Aigremont</strong>, dating from the 18th century.</p>

<p><em>Turning to the left into the Rue de Roubaix, the tourist comes out in front

<h4>ROUBAIX GATE</h4>

<p>The <strong>Roubaix</strong> or <strong>St. Maurice Gate</strong> dates from about 1620, and was
erected from the plans of <em>Jean de Mesre</em>, <em>Jean Petit</em> and <em>Jean Fayet</em>. Of
its three entrances, the middle one only is ancient. Above each entrance is
carved a coat of arms. The one in the centre, forming a tympanum, is between
two pilasters supporting a triangular pediment. At the top is a row of battlements,
with a stone niche surmounted by a broken pediment in the centre.
The niche contains the <strong>statue</strong> of a woman.</p>

<p>Over the passage is a slate-roofed building ornamented with coloured
glazed bricks.</p>

<p><em>Go through the gate and take the Rue du Faubourg de Roubaix to the <strong>Eastern
Cemetery</strong>.</em> The graves of <strong>Jacquet</strong> and <strong>Trulin</strong> are in this cemetery <em>(see photos

<h4>ROUBAIX-TOURCOING</h4>

<p class="center">From Lille to Roubaix and Tourcoing, via the Boulevard des
Trois Villes.</p>

<p class="center">Total Distance, including return journey: 16 miles.
</p>

<p><strong>ROUBAIX</strong>, one of France's <strong>chief industrial centres</strong>, is of very ancient
origin. The first important mention of it in history, however, only goes
back to the 15th century (1469), when one, <em>Peter of Roubaix</em>, obtained permission
from Charles the Bald to manufacture cloth. It was occupied and
sacked several times by foreign invaders. In 1792 it was taken by the
Austrians, in 1794 by the English, and in 1914 by the Germans.</p>

<p>In 1554, Roubaix, which had become a rival to Lille, obtained permission
from Charles Quint and later (1609) from the Council of the Arch-Dukes of
Austria, to manufacture velvet, fustian and common grey linen cloth.</p>

<p>A decree of the State Council in 1762, granting similar privileges to all
the parishes, was the subject of long lawsuits, which were decided against
Lille.</p>

<p>The popular song-writer, <em>Gustave Nadaud</em> (1820-1893) was a native of
Roubaix.</p>

<p>There are no monuments in the town anterior to the Revolution.</p>

<p>The population, largely composed of the working classes, increased rapidly
between 1881 and 1891, and numbered 120,000 in 1914. The suburbs:
Wattrelos, Lys, Croix, Wasquehal and Mouvaux, are extensions of the town
itself and are growing steadily.</p>

<p>Since 1830 Roubaix has been an important centre for <strong>wool combing</strong>
and <strong>spinning</strong>, the machinery employed comprising 700 washing, carding,
combing and weaving machines and 300,000 spindles. Before the War,
the wool-spinning mills produced <strong>6,000 tons</strong> of yarn annually, the whole
of which was used in France.</p>

<p>The <strong>dyeing</strong> and <strong>finishing</strong> industries, which date back to 1760, had
steadily prospered. In 1914, 48 firms, employing 8,000 workpeople, were
engaged in this branch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><strong>TOURCOING</strong> shared the fate of Flanders during the course of its history.
The English and Flemish burnt it during the 14th century, while the French
seized it in 1477. In 1566-1568 it was twice sacked by the Gueux, and the
Duke of Albe held it to ransom. From 1667 to 1708 it was annexed to France
by Louis XIV. Later it fell successively under the yoke of the Austrians,
Dutch and Saxons. On May 18th, 1794, the French beat the Duke of York's
troops at Tourcoing, and paved the way for the Victory of Fleurus on
June 26th.</p>

<p><strong>Tourcoing</strong> is essentially an <strong>industrial town</strong>. Its population has
steadily increased since 1491, when it numbered 2,500. In 1851 it had grown
to 27,615 and in 1914 to 82,644.</p>

<p>From time immemorial Tourcoing has been a <strong>wool manufacturing</strong>
centre. Here, the wool is first washed and dried, then treated with cocoanut
fat, before combing, and lastly spun. Since 1845 the combing has been
done mechanically (Heilman's system). The same may be said of the spinning,
which, since 1811, was done on Bobo machines. Before the War, <strong>5,000
tons</strong> of spun wool were exported annually.</p>

<p>Among the <strong>specialities</strong> made at Tourcoing were: <strong>fine thread</strong>, <strong>tablecloths</strong>
and <strong>tapestry-work</strong> of mixed silk and mercerised cotton (well known
for their fine colouring and reasonable price), and <strong>carpets</strong> of the Wilton and
Oriental types.</p>

<h4>ROUBAIX</h4>

<p>Itinerary: <em>Leave Lille by the Boulevard Carnot at the Place du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre,
between the Theatre and the New Bourse. Follow the Boulevard des Trois
Villes to <strong>Roubaix</strong>. Enter the latter by the Rue de Lille, follow its continuation,
the Rue Neuve, which leads to the Grande Place: <strong>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</strong> and <strong>Church
of St. Martin</strong>.</em></p>


<h5>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</h5>

<p>The present building is the work of the architect <em>Laloux</em> (1911); it replaced
the old Town Hall, built in 1845 and pulled down in 1907. The latter,
as the town grew, had several times been enlarged and otherwise altered,
but had finally become too small for a population of more than
50,000 workpeople and an annual production exceeding 500,000,000 frs.
in value.</p>

<p>The new Town Hall is a fine building, with a <strong>frieze</strong> representing scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
from the local industries. A wing on the right serves as the <strong>Stock-Exchange</strong>,
while another on the left contains the town's records.</p>


<h5>Church of St. Martin</h5>

<p>This church, which was rebuilt and transformed in 1849, recalls vaguely
the 15th century Gothic style of the original edifice. Only the <strong>steeple</strong>
is ancient. The church has five naves and contains four <strong>ancient tombs</strong>
and a Flemish <strong>altar-screen</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Take the Rue de la Gare, to the Nord-West of the Grande Place.</em> At the
corner of the Rue Nain is the <strong>National School of Industrial Arts</strong>, to which
has been added a <strong>Museum</strong> of <strong>Paintings</strong> and <strong>Sculpture</strong> (recently organized
by <em>M. Victor Champier</em>), a <strong>Textile Museum</strong> and a <strong>Library</strong> containing
15,000 volumes.</p>

<p>The School proper (whose courses, which are well attended, include dyeing,
spinning, weaving, etc.) and its annexes (museum and library) are installed
in a fine building erected in 1889 from the plans of the architect, <em>F. Dutert</em>,
who designed the Galerie des Machines in Paris. Built of dressed stone
and brick, the three doorways lead to the library, museums (sculpture, paintings,
art-history and textiles) and the public lecture-hall.</p>

<p>The <strong>central pediment</strong> by Allar, represents Industry and Art. On the
<strong>pediments of the pavilions</strong> are symbolized: The Arts <em>(by Lanson)</em> and
the Sciences <em>(by Hughes)</em>. The <strong>frieze</strong> <em>(by Laoust)</em> represents, symbolically,
the various branches of learning taught in the school.</p>

<h5>The Church of St. Christopher</h5>

<p>The original church was erected in the 12th or 13th century, but was
entirely rebuilt in 1860, in 15th century Gothic style. The body of brick
and stone, with its various balustrades, graceful sculptured pinnacles, and
richly decorated tracery windows, recalls the churches of that period, but
it is evident from the aspect of the interior, where the decoration is less
rich, that the church is modern. The spire above the tower is 17th century.</p>

<p>To the N.W. of the church is the <strong>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</strong>, a modern, French
Renaissance building, surmounted by a large dome. It contains a <strong>library</strong>
of about 10,000 volumes, a <strong>museum</strong> of fine <strong>paintings</strong>, mostly modern <em>(Paul
Chabas</em>, <em>David</em>, <em>Guardi</em>, <em>Harpignies</em>, <em>Peter Naefs</em>, <em>Henri Zo</em>, <em>Henri Zuber)</em> and
specimens of <strong>old cloth-stuffs</strong> of local manufacture.</p>

<p class="center"><em>17, Rue de Suresnes, PARIS-VIIIe</em>
</p>

<p>The "Office National du Tourisme" was created by
Act of Parliament on April 8, 1910, and reorganised
in 1917. It enjoys civil privileges and financial autonomy.</p>

<p>It is directed by an administrative council chosen by the
Minister of Public Works.</p>

<p>Its mission is to seek out every means of developing
travel; to urge and if necessary to take any measure capable
of ameliorating the conditions of the transport, circulation and
sojourn of tourists.</p>

<p>It co-ordinates the efforts of touring societies and industries,
encourages them in the execution of their programmes and
stimulates legislative and administrative initiative with regard
to the development of travel in France.</p>

<p>It promotes understanding between the public services,
the great transport companies, the "Syndicats d'Initiative"
and the "Syndicats Professionnels."</p>

<p>It organises propaganda in foreign countries; and tends
towards the creation of Travel Enquiry Offices in France and
abroad, with a view to making known the scenery and
monuments of France, as well as the health-giving powers of
French mineral waters, spas and bathing places.</p>
